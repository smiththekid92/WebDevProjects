# Portfolio Project - CSS: Selectors & Visual Rules (pt. 2)

STEP 1.
* Look over index.html to review the different HTML elements you have to work with, then navigate to style.css.
    * Start by making the header section stand out a bit more. Make the background color of the header class CornflowerBlue.

STEP 2. 
* Now change how the text is aligned in the top header section so that it's in the center.

STEP 3.
* Next, make the paragraph below Olivia’s name have a larger text size. Twenty pixels seems a sufficient place to start, whatever you think would look better.
    * *Hint: It's the "about-me" class*

STEP 4.
* The .about-me paragraph looks a little dark against the light blue background, maybe it would look nice if it blended more with the background.
* Use the opacity property to make it 50% transparent.

STEP 5. 
* Make the section titles classes bold.

STEP 6.
* Change the main title color so that it matches the background color more nicely. 
* *Hint: use the h1 tag*

STEP 7.
* Change the default font of the page to something other than Times New Roman.

STEP 8.
* Finally, let’s make the background of the page more interesting.
    * Let's give the *entire* page a background image.
