# Blog Project - Semantic HTML

**Navigation Bar**

STEP 1.
* A common usage of a navigation bar is to create shortcuts for a webpage. This will allow the user to go directly to the information they want to access through the navigation links.

* Create a `<nav>` element underneath the opening `<body>` tag.

STEP 2. 
* Within the `<nav>` element, create a `<ul>` element to create an unordered list. The unordered list should contain the following three items:

    * Blog
    * Media
    * About

Use an `<li> `element with `<a href=""></a>` nested within the <li> element to link the content to the nav bar. You may notice that the navbar doesn’t work right now but don’t worry, once the content is added, the navbar will be fully functional!
